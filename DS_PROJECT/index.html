         <h3>This notebook project uses the employee_churn_trimmed.csv which contains data on employees who quit or
            stayed at theirjobs, to uncover what could be causing churn and thus present these insights and findings
            using matplotlib and
            seaborn
            visualization plots.
            <br><br><br>
            The Employee data includes:

         <p><br><br>Employee Base -> Age Here, to plot the distribution of one numerical variable ,Age, I used a
            distribution
            plot
            from
            seaborn to try understand how old is the employee base</p><br><br>
         <h2>Age Distribution of Employees</h2><br>
         <br><img src="1.jpg"><br>


         <p>In the following, We have tried to visualize what is the distribution of age, grouped by gender
            In this plot, I plotted on a figure with multiple subplots called axes.<br>
         </p><br>
         <br>
         <h2>Age Distribution By Gender</h2>
         <br><img src="2.jpg"><br>
         <p>Visualize education level of employees by gender <br> We have used seaborn's countplot to plot
            counts/distribution of the categorical variable, education level and ordered by Gender variables.<br></p>
         <h2>Employee Churn Rate By Distance</h2>
         <br><img src="3.jpg"><br>
         <p>We explored the data further to understand if there's a relationship between age or distance from home and
            their churning So to visualize this, We used a boxplot to plot Age distributions on the Atrrition
            categorical
            levels - Churned,Stayed From the plot, we can tell that the people who left were mostly above 32 years
            approximately.<br>
            We can also tell that most people who left the company lived farther away from the place of work than the
            rest
            who were nearer.<br></p><br>
         <br><img src="4.jpg"><br>
         <h2>Churn Rate Based on Relationships Satisfaction</h2>
         <p>Visualize Churn based on Relationship Satisfaction
            Before, plotting I computed the Attritions in terms of rates as percentages in relation to each type of
            relationshipsatisfaction<br>
            As from the plot we can tell that those who churned the most, had a low relationship satisfaction
            rating.<br>
         </p><br>
         <br><img src="5.jpg"><br>
         <p>We have visualized all the rating surveys replies given by the employees i.e.EnvironmentSatisfaction,
            JobSatisfaction,
            JobInvolvement, WorkLifeBalance against the Attrition rates on axes plots similar to the Below figure.<br>
         </p>
         <br>
         <br><img src="6.jpg"><br>
         <h2>Monthly Income by Age </h2>
         <p><br> What can we do to decrease churning?<br>

            Do higher salaries create less churn? <br>Can this be applied to all ages? <br>To understand this, We have
            used
            a
            scatterplot
            to
            visualize the relationship between two numeric values, Age and MonthlyIncome.<br></p>
         <br><img src="7.jpg"><br>
         <h2>Salary Hike Percentage By Monthly Income</h2>
         <p><br>
            Did last year's salary increases impact churn?<br>

            we have visualized the relationship between the Monthly Income and the PercentSalaryHike using a
            swarmplot.<br>

            A swarmplot are used to show the relationship and distribution of values for one categorical, raise_category
            and one
            numerical variable,MonthlyIncome.<br>

            But first, we have segmented and sorted the PercentSalaryHike into a categorical bins named raise_category
            using the
            pandas'
            method, cut.<br><br>
